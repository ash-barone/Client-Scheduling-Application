::Running the Program::
To run this program, first, open the folder in IntelliJ. Next, you have to update your IDE settings to the program,
To do this, you will access File>Project Structure to create a PATH_TO_FX leading to your JavaFX SDK.
Then, you will access File>Settings to add your JavaFX SDK library and MySQL Connector library.
Finally you will create a new Application configuration with the following format:
 - Select main.Main as your Main class.
 - Click Modify Options and enable VM Option. In that field, you will paste this:
     ---module-path ${PATH_TO_FX} --add-modules javafx.fxml,javafx.controls,javafx.graphics
 - Next, you will ensure you have the correct JavaFX SDK selected in the top combo box.
 - Finally, you can name your configuration and click Apply then Okay.
If you need to change the Database credentials and information, you can do so in src/dbaccess/JDBC.java to ensure proper connection.

::Additional Report::
In addition to the two reports required for this application, I have included a third report to calculate the number of customers in each distinct division.
This report will allow the business to better serve their customers in each division by adjusting to any increase or decrease in counts.
